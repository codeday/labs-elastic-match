# Testing and Setup Stuff
This folder contains all the scripts and files that were used to figure out how elasticsearch works and to test the database. They are still here because I have needed to refrence them a few times in setting up the production version, so I am keeping them around longer just in case. 

Of note are the following files:
* `query.py`, which contains example queries for the API
* `testing.ipynb`, which contains the beta form of the long weighted query used for matching
* `helpers.py`, which was a bunch of helpers for data importing, but all of this has now been outsourced to Tyler.
